# wpcssstyletextwidget


This is a very simple widget that helps in creating the text widget (standard) but with a style that we can define.
I think it simplicity is it function especially for that one that is a focal point of attention widget, which happen often, if not we will call this a post or page hehehe.
The style is standard style for the html div tag
I find this very useful when working with wordpress widgets especially if I have created may of inactive widgets that I already defined but still not using it yet. I can see the widget is all about in a faster manner form my admin menu
